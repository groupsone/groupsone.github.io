						<p>Here are some real techniques which will improve your
							english language skills and how you can remember tons of english
							words.</p>
						<p class="text-danger">
							<strong>1. Be Mad:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Yes! I mean it. As soon as you see a new word, dont lookup
							the word meaning immediately, instead try this out.</p>
						<div class="subpoints">
							<ol class="">
								<li class="">First break the word into simple terms as much
									as possible
									<p>eg: esoteric : Break the word as esort + teric (t
										repeated here - left to your imagination. No rules here.)</p>
								</li>
								<li><p>Form a crazy story: Take each word or individual
										broken words . Link them with similar known words . Similar as
										in rhyming or similar sound words or any other near by words.
										Form a crazy story with the broken words. The craziest and
										funniest stories you form, the most stronger you remember.</p>
									<p>eg: esort ~ a sort of , tic ~ trick (near by sound) . So
										esortic can be remembered as 'a sort of trick'.</p></li>

								<li>Visualize the whole story as much as you can and relate
									it to the original meaning . The stronger you visualize the
									better you remember.
									<p>
										eg: 'a sort a trick' =&gt; Imagine a magician doing a funny
										trick to impress a girl :-) . Original meaning: something
										understood by only few people. Ofcourse! only few people knew
										tricks to impress a girl right <i
											class="em  em-stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye"></i>!!. <br>So
										esoteric is something that is understood by only few people.
										Imagination is left to you
									</p>
							</ol>
							<p>Trust me this is the best technique (also called mneumonic
								technique) I always follow to remember new words. It will
								definitely work for most of the words.</p>

						<p class="text-danger">
							<strong>2. Where the hell did the word come from?</strong>
						</p>
						Once you see the word , try to connect with words which you
						already know. Every word will have some some origin. So figure the
						origin of the word and form the full meaning.
						<p>For this technique to work , you should by heart some
							important root words. You can view the important list of root
							words for GRE/Toefl preparation from here.</p>
						<p>eg: Novice : Nov means 'new'. So novice is some one who is
							new to a field.</p>
						<p>Good dictionaries will give you information about the
							origins of words. So look at them to learn more words.</p>
						<p>
							You can view important root list here: <a target="_blank"

						</p>

						<p class="text-danger">
							<strong>3. Am 'I' really useful:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>No No! 'I' don't mean about you. 'I' here represents the
							word you actually see. Thats the attitude you need to have when
							you learn a new word.</p>
						<p>Once you see a word, try to form a quick funny or useful
							sentence with that word with a real world scenario or example.
							Share that sentence with your friends or in a group with its
							usage. This will help you to build your vocabulary and helps you
							recollect when you try to write an essay /AWA or speak with
							bigger audience.</p>
						<p>eg: Esoteric usage: Rocket science is an esoteric subject
							which most of us are unaware about.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Learn 5 to 10 words each day as a habit: The more you learn
							, the better score you get. Even though we can answer many Verbal
							questions with answers in GRE/TOEFL, there will certainly be some
							words which you dont know. So learn as much as you can.</p>
						<p class="text-warning">To help you out in this and to improve
							your vocabulary skills, every day I will be sharing 5 to 10 MOST
							IMPORTANT GRE/TOEFL words you need to learn. Practise , learn and
							share your comments here.To get them</p>
